# BEEP - Open source bee monitoring (v2.2.1)


BEEP is a combination of a bee monitoring (Laravel PHP) framework API + an (Angular JS) app and a (Influx) time series sensor data database. There are also first steps of creating cost efficient measurement hardware.

It's key feature is to integrate a user friendly responsive app for manual inspections with automatically measured sensor data.

# System overview
![BEEP System overview](https://github.com/beepnl/BEEP/raw/master/BEEP-system-overview.png)

You are free to use the BEEP app, it's free and it will be developed further in the near future. If you would like to install it on your own server, or contribute; please read on below.

# Installation of API and APP (on your own server)

## 0. Server specs

* Linux Debian (8+)
* Software installed
  * PHP 7.1+
  * MariaDB/MySQL
  * Apache 2 (or Nginx, creating Nginx 'server blocks' in step 4)
  * InfluxDB (https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/introduction/installation/)
  * [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) - Installation tool for PHP/Laravel dependencies for API
  * [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) - Installation tool for Javascript/Angular dependencies for App
  * Redis-Server (https://redis.io/download)
* Optional: Letsencrypt SSL certificate generation


**NB: You can use this gist to install all the software you need: [LAMP PHP 7.2](https://gist.github.com/pvgennip/84f935e13207db71259f1f57c2667bbd)**


## 1. Clone this repo anywhere you like
```git clone https://github.com/beepnl/BEEP.git```

## 2. Database

Create a MySQL database (type: InnoDB, encoding: UTF_8, collation: utf8_unicode_ci) called: 

```bee_data```

**NB: Make sure to pass the user and credentials to the newly made .env file after step 3.**


## 3. Install required vendor libraries 

a. Make the ```run_actions.sh``` file executable by ```chmod +x run_actions.sh```. This bash script will install all the packages and vendor dependencies that you need at once.

b. Then run it: ```./run_actions.sh```

## 4. Set up your end-points

a. Make sure your server has 2 different virtual hosts for the API and the APP

NB: On Amazon AWS (Bitnami LAMP_7.1): 
a. Make sure your Bitnami server includes your apps/apache_vhost.conf in 
```
sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache2/conf/bitnami/bitnami-apps-vhosts.conf
```

Contains one or more Includes:
```
# Bitnami applications installed in a Virtual Host
Include "/opt/bitnami/apps/apache/portal-vhost.conf"
```

Bitnami restart apache server:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh restart apache
```


API (replace 'beep.nl' with your own server/test domain)
```
<VirtualHost api.beep.nl:80>
    
    DocumentRoot /var/www/bee/public
    ServerName "api.beep.nl"

    <Directory /var/www/bee/public/>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        allow from all
    </Directory>

</VirtualHost>
```

APP (replace 'beep.nl' with your own server)
```
<VirtualHost app.beep.nl:80>
    
    DocumentRoot /var/www/bee/public/webapp
    ServerName "app.beep.nl"

    <Directory /var/www/bee/public/webapp/>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        allow from all
    </Directory>

</VirtualHost>
```

b. Install SSL certificates to your endpoints with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/)

On AWS:
```
sudo /opt/bitnami/letsencrypt/scripts/generate-certificate.sh -m pim@iconize.nl -d api.beep.nl -d app.beep.nl
```

On other servers with command: ```sudo certbot --authenticator webroot --installer apache```

## 5. Add Influx database
```
influx
> CREATE USER user_influx WITH PASSWORD 'pass_influx' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
> CREATE DATABASE bee_data
> exit
```
**NB: Make sure to pass the user and credentials to the .env file that has been created in step 3.**
**NB: If your Influx version was < 1.1.x (no TSI support), when using backups to transfer data: first install the old version that you are currently using on a new server, import the backups, then update to the newest Influx version!**

## 6. If you would like to easily deploy your fork (or this repo), 

a. Make sure to add your repo to git remote: ```git remote set url https://github.com/beepnl/BEEP.git```

b. Run ```./deploy.sh``` to update your clone on any server


# Configuring the back-end system

## 1. Check database tables

If you did not run ```./run_actions```, please do so, to install all the database tables and set up the default categorization.

## 2. Set up valid credentials

a. Set up e-mail credentials in the ```.env``` config file

[b. For the webapp to reach the API, rename the file 'public/webapp/js/constants.js.example' to 'public/webapp/js/constants.js' and edit it to change the 'api_url' to your own back-end API end-point]

c. To enable schedules (e.g. for loading weather data), install a crontab with ```sudo crontab -e``` and add: ```* * * * * cd /home/bitnami/apps/appdir && /opt/bitnami/php/bin/php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1```

## 3. Register new user

a. Go to ```api.[your_domain]/webapp#!/login/create```

b. Create a new user

c. Promote the user to 'superadmin'

Open your database (with a database viewer like PhpMyadmin, Sequel Pro, MySQL Workbench, etc.), or just do a command line query: 
Define a relation in table ```role_user``` with ```(1,1)``` (linking user_id 1 to role_id 1). 
SQL Command: "INSERT INTO `role_user` (`user_id`, `role_id`) VALUES ('1', '1')"
Your user has just been promoted to the super administrator of the system, so you can use the back-end management interface to configure the complete system.

d. Go to ```api.[your_domain]/admin``` to log in with the same credentials that you created your app user with in step 3b.

e. You should see the back-end dashboard, looking like this:

## Management interface
![BEEP Management interface](https://github.com/beepnl/BEEP/blob/bob-additions/BEEP-management-interface.png)


# Installation using docker compose

A simple setup for small installations can be achived with [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). The tool will spinn up a mysqldb, influd, a webserver and initialize the beep database.

1. [Install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
2. Checkout BEEP and switch into the code repository
3. Adjust `docker-compose.yaml`(set suitable environment variables).
4. Run `docker-compose up`. During the first start, you might see some database connectivity issues. Docker compose will restart the BEEP Server component untill a database connection is available. So don't worry.
5. Register as a new user: [http://localhost:8000/webapp](http://localhost:8000/webapp).
6. Grant user administrator rights: `docker-compose exec  mysql mysql -h localhost -P 3306 -ppass -u user -D bee_data -Bse "INSERT INTO role_user (user_id,role_id) VALUES(1,1);"`
7. Login to mamagement interface: [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin)

To upgrade beep to the latest version, simply stop and start docker-compose.

As the setup is based on docker containers, code changes inside the repository will not have an effeact till the underlying docker image is updated. 


# Get your BEEP base measurement data into the BEEP app

1. Create a TTN account at https://console.thethingsnetwork.org/ (or other LoRa network) and create an HTTP integration pointing to https://api.beep.nl/api/lora_sensors, or point your own measurement device data stream HTTP POST to https://api.beep.nl/api/sensors (please refer to our [Slack channel](beep-global.slack.com) for API description)
2. Use the native [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_app_beep_nl.BEEP_commissioning_V06&gl=NL) / [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/beep-base/id1495605010) app to configure your BEEP base by Bluetooth. 
3. With the app, connect the BEEP base to the BEEP TTN network (auto configuration), or connect the BEEP base (manually) to your own LoRa network
4. The native app adds a BEEP base measurement device to your BEEP account
5. You can see the measurement data at the Measurements menu item of the webapp
